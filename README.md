# Mapping_Earthquakes
Create Earthquake maps using Leaflet.js, Javascript and HTML.

## Overview

The project's goal is to visually demonstrate the variations in the earthquake magnitues that have ocurred during the past seven days around the world. 

The location and magnitude of the eartquakes were retrieved using GeoJSON data from the earthquake data USGS website. THe good thing about using this website data is that it updates each time you access to your JSON.

In this project we:
Used different map styles
Change the line color, marker types and sizes
Add pop ups with the info about the earthquakes.
